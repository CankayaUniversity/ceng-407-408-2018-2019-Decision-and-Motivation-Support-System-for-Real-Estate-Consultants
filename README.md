# Project Description

Real Estate Consultants who work for a company independently face several motivational and operational challenges. As they have free working hours and not forced to work at certain time periods they easily loose their motivation. Moreover, they have difficulty in deciding on accepting or rejecting a new portfolio for better profit. 

This project aims to provide a decision and motivation support system to let Real Estate Consultant better function in their operational procedures. The system will enable Consultants to manage their Portfolios by viewing, adding, deleting, updating related information. They will have a performance measurement based on their weekly successful sales.  

The consultants will set goals and the system will let them to reach to those goals through warnings. New portfolios will be evaluated through data mining methods and consultants will be supported in their decisions for the acceptance of the portfolio.

Consultants will have virtual diary to keep track of their agenda and will have loan calculation, lease contracts warnings as well. Moreover, user will be able to see the other consultants’  weekly/monthly performance and profit to encourage user to be lead in the lists and make more profit. While consultants are setting daily/weekly goals the decision support system will help them with intelligent data analysis.
